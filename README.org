#+TITLE: Inquiry

This may /LOOK/ like an empty github repository but it *acutually* is a robust proof-of-concept for messaging other Github users. Currently it's not possible to message a user on Github but there are many occasions when it might be  necissary to reach out to an account that does not provide contact information.

This repository exists so you can raise a notifiction to a user via the [[https://github.com/noonker/inquiry/issues][issues]] page. All one has to do is @tag the person they wish to contact to get that users attention.

I hope someone has found this useful. Thanks for looking ðŸ‘€
