#+TITLE: Inquiry

This may /LOOK/ like an empyt github repository but what it *acutlly is a robust proof-of-concept for messaging other Github users. Currently it's not possible to message a user on Github but there are many occations when it might be  necissary to reach out to an account that does not povide contact links.

This repository exists so you can raise a notiificatino to a user via the [[https://github.com/noonker/inquiry/issues][issues]] page. All one has to do is @tag the person they wish to contact to get that users attention.

I hope someone has found this useful. Thanks for looking ðŸ‘€
